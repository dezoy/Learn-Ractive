# learn-ractive - project setup

Created with the [grunt-init gui template](https://github.com/GuardianInteractive/grunt-init-template).

***

1. Install grunt and its dependencies
-------------------------------------
This applies whether you are initialising the project, or you've cloned the repo from GitHub (as development dependencies are excluded from the repo by .gitignore):

    $ npm install

***

This section obviously only applies if you are initialising the project.

2. Create local repo
--------------------
    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'first commit woo!'


3. Create remote repo
---------------------
For clarity, it is recommended that you give the repo the same name as this project (**learn-ractive)**:

<http://github.com/organizations/GuardianInteractive/repositories/new>


4. Link the two
---------------
Assuming you called the remote repo **learn-ractive**, you would do

    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/GuardianInteractive/learn-ractive.git
    $ git push -u origin master

***

5. Start grunting
-----------------
    $ grunt

To watch the styles and data folders for changes:

    $ grunt watch

To launch a server - <http://local.static.guim.co.uk:9876> (you can change the port in Gruntfile.js):

    $ grunt server

> *It is recommended that you edit your [hosts file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) so that `local.static.guim.co.uk` redirects to `localhost`. This avoids cross-domain nonsense, e.g. with fonts. But if you haven't done that you can still access the site at <http://localhost:9876>).*

***

6. Create your app
------------------
Project anatomy:

* **`boot`**  
your boot files, which are responsible for doing any feature detection or picking a code path (if multiple code paths exist, e.g. mobile vs desktop), then loading the interactive. These files have access to `<%= projectUrl %>` and `<%= versionDir %>` variables, which are set as appropriate on deployment

* **`data`**  
files in here will be bundled together as data.json (see [grunt-dir2json](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-dir2json) for more info)

* **`gubbins`**  
for project-specific stuff that shouldn't end up in the finished product, e.g. artwork, shell scripts, Excel files, whatever

* **`js`**  
your scripts. The project template currently assumes you are using AMD

* **`preview`**  
files to enable previewing the project at different screen sizes etc. (This folder also contains `default.html`, which is used to render the final `index.html`)

* **`files`**  
any additional files you want to include in the project, besides your index.html, min.css and data.json files (which are auto-generated). E.g. images

* **`styles`**  
.scss files, from which `min.css` is generated

* **`codeobject.html`**  
the markup that the user is presented with at launch, whether it is squirted onto a Guardian page, or part of a dedicated `index.html` file

(The above is correct at the time of writing... if it looks out of date, please correct!)

***

7. Build
--------
    $ grunt build

You can check that the built version behaves as expected by doing

    $ grunt sanitycheck

and visiting <http://local.static.guim.co.uk:9876>.


8. Deploy
---------
You will need to have AWS credentials, either in your environment or in a JSON file somewhere. To add credentials to your environment on OS X, open `~/.bash_profile` and add the following lines (with your details, natch):

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='yourKeyIdHere'
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='yourSecretAccessKeyHere'

Alternatively add the credentials to a JSON file, and specify its path as the `credentials` option to the `deploy` task:

    {
    	"accessKeyId": "yourKeyIdHere",
    	"secretAccessKey": "yourSecretAccessKeyHere"
    }

It is possible to specify credentials directly within the task config. **Do not do this.** You may accidentally push your credentials to GitHub.

To deploy, simply do

    $ grunt deploy

This will upload the contents of the `dist` folder to our S3 account (the `gdn-cdn` bucket). It will then be accessible from <http://interactive.guim.co.uk/2013/may/learn-ractive/v/1/index.html> (the version number will increment with each deploy).
