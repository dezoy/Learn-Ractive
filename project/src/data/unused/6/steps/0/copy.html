<h2>Stay classy</h2>

<p>You may have been wondering how you would go about making the code in the last tutorial more general, so that you could easily build a sortable table out of any data.</p>

<p>The answer is <code>Ractive.extend</code>. In this tutorial we will create a new <code>Table</code> <em>class</em>, which inherits from the base <code>Ractive</code> class and adds some new tricks.</p>

<p>First, let's remove the hard-coded column headers from the template:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
<tr>
  <th>#</th>
  {{#headers}}
    <th class='sortable' proxy-tap='sort' data-column='{{id}}'>{{name}}</th>
  {{/headers}}
</tr>
</pre>

<p>Then, we need to 



<div class='hint'>
	<p>Of course, you could just use a library that creates sortable tables. There are some very good ones. But then you have to learn a new library, and potentially submit to that library's design philosophy.</p>

	<p><span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> is all about flexibility. If you want to change the design or behaviour of a component (say, adding a class name to a particular element), the power to do so is in your hands &ndash; the template is easy to understand and tweak, and the view logic is straightforward.</p>

	<p>It's better to be able to build your own solution than to rely on developers maintaining high quality and up-to-date documentation.</p>
