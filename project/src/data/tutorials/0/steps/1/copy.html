<h2>That's not very exciting</h2>

<p>You're right, it's not. Let's make our template more templatey &ndash; replace the hard-coded text with some variables:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>&lt;p&gt;{{greeting}} {{recipient}}!&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Then, add some data to it, by adding a <code>data</code> option to our Ractive so that the code looks like this:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
var ractive = new Ractive({
  el: output,
  template: template,
  data: { greeting: 'Hello', recipient: 'world' }
});
</pre>

<p>Execute the code (click in the JavaScript box, hit <kbd>Shift-Enter</kbd>). It should look exactly as it did before.</p>
