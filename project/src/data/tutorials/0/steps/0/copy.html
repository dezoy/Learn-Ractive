<h2>Welcome to Learn Ractive.js!</h2>

<p>This is a set of interactive tutorials which you can take at your own pace. Each tutorial consists of a number of steps &ndash; you're currently on step 1 of the 'Hello world!' tutorial.</p>

<p>At any time you can reset the current step by clicking the <strong>reset</strong> button above.</p>

<h3>Let's get started</h3>

<p>Try creating a new Ractive by executing the JavaScript on the right &ndash; click in the <strong>#javascript</strong> box, and hit <kbd>Shift-Enter</kbd> (or click the <strong>execute</strong> button).</p>

<div class='hint'>
	<p>In later steps, if you can't get it to work (or if you're just lazy!) you can click the 'fix code' button below to insert working code as though you'd followed the instructions exactly. For now, it's disabled.</p>

	<p>Throughout the tutorials, boxes like this will contain technical notes and asides, for the particularly nerdy or curious.</p>
