<h2>Using Ractive.js for graphics</h2>

<p><span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> works with SVG just as easily as with HTML. This makes it possible to create data-driven graphics using the same declarative structure as we use with the rest of the web.</p>

<p>Here, we're using the same data as in the previous example to draw a combination area range and line chart. It's more of a demo than a lesson &ndash; I recommend spending some time learning how to use SVG if you're not familiar with it, but it's out of the scope of this tutorial.</p>
