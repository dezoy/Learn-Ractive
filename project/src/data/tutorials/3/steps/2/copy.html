<h2>Unsubscribing from events</h2>

<p>There are a couple of ways to unsubscribe from events. If you've used jQuery, you'll be used to this syntax:</p>

<pre class='prettypring lang-js'>
view.on( 'select', selectHandler );

// later...
view.off( 'select', selectHandler );
</pre>

<p>That's fine, as long as you stored a reference to <code>selectHandler</code> (i.e. you didn't just use an anonymous function). If you didn't, you can also do this:</p>

<pre class='prettypring lang-js'>
view.off( 'select' ); // unsubscribes ALL 'select' handlers
view.off(); // unsubscribes all handlers of any type
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can do this:</p>

<pre class='prettypring lang-js'>
var listener = view.on( 'select', selectHandler );

var otherListeners = view.on({
  activate: function () { alert( 'Activating' ); },
  dectivate: function () { alert( 'Deactivating!' ); }
});

// later...
listener.cancel();
otherListeners.cancel();
</pre>

<p>Try adding a 'silence' button which removes the 'activate' and 'deactivate' handlers.</p>

<div class='hint'>
	<p>We haven't yet covered <code>view.teardown()</code>, which removes your view from the DOM and cleans up after it. However as you'd expect this will remove any event handlers bound with <code>view.on()</code>.</p>
