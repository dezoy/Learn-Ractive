<h2>Yo dawg, I heard you like properties</h2>

<p>Ractive uses the <a href='http://mustache.github.io/'>mustache syntax</a>, which supports <em>nested properties</em> &ndash; in JavaScript-land, that means properties that are objects with their own properties (which might be objects with their own properties...).</p>

<p>Let's say we were building an app that displayed information about different countries. An object representing a country could look like this:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
{
  name: 'The UK',
  climate: { temperature: 'cold', rainfall: 'excessive' },
  population: 62641000,
  capital: { name: 'London', lat: 51.5171, lon: -0.1062 }
}
</pre>

<p>Add that data to our JavaScript &ndash; there's a placeholder <code>country</code> property.</p>

<p>We can refer to these nested properties in our template using dot notation. So to refer to the country's name, we use <code>{{country.name}}</code>.</p>

<p>Go ahead and replace the placeholders in the template with mustaches. Don't forget the <code>href</code> on the 'see map' link. If you get stuck, click the <strong>fix code</strong> button below.</p>

<p>Execute the code. You should see a description of the UK. For extra credit, update the ractive from the console.</p>
