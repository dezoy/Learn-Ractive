<h2>Creating a Slideshow class</h2>

<p>Time to create our <code>Slideshow</code> class:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
var Slideshow = Ractive.extend({
  template: template, // this will be applied to all Slideshow instances
  
  // method for changing the currently displayed image
  goto: function ( imageNum ) {
    // goto method goes here...
  },

  // initialisation code
  init: function ( options ) {
    // initialisation code goes here...
  }
});
</pre>

<p>Each <code>Slideshow</code> instance will have a <code>goto</code> method in addition to the normal <code>Ractive</code> instance methods. Any set-up work we need to do can happen in the <code>init</code> method, which gets called as soon as the template has been rendered.</p>

<p>Let's write our <code>goto</code> method:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
function ( imageNum ) {
  // make sure the image number is between 0...
  while ( imageNum < 0 ) {
    imageNum += this.images.length;
  }

  // and the maximum
  imageNum = imageNum % this.images.length;

  // update the view
  this.set( 'image', this.images[ imageNum ] );
  this.currentImage = imageNum;
}
</pre>

<p>This method presupposes the existence of <code>this.images</code>. We can add this property, as well as the proxy event handling code, in our <code>init</code> method:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
function ( options ) {
  var self = this;

  this.images = options.images;

  this.on({
    prev: function () { self.goto( self.currentImage - 1 ); },
    next: function () { self.goto( self.currentImage + 1 ); }
  });

  this.goto( 0 ); // start with the first image
}
</pre>

<p>Let's add some code to instantiate the slideshow with our gifs:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
var slideshow = new Slideshow({
  el: output,
  images: [
    { src: 'files/gifs/problem.gif', caption: 'Trying to work out a problem after the 5th hour' },
    { src: 'files/gifs/css.gif', caption: 'Trying to fix someone else\'s CSS' },
    { src: 'files/gifs/ie.gif', caption: 'Testing interface on Internet Explorer' },
    { src: 'files/gifs/w3c.gif', caption: 'Trying to code to W3C standards' },
    { src: 'files/gifs/build.gif', caption: 'Visiting the guy that wrote the build scripts' },
    { src: 'files/gifs/test.gif', caption: 'I don\'t need to test that. What can possibly go wrong?' }
  ]
});
</pre>

<p>Go ahead and execute the code &ndash; you should now have a working slideshow.</p>

<div class='hint'>
  <p>Needless to say, you could add as many bells and whistles as you wanted &ndash; fading or sliding transitions, image preloading, thumbnails, touchscreen gesture controls, and so on.</p>

  <p>You could, of course, just use an existing image slideshow library. But then you would have to learn that library, and potentially submit to its design philosophy.</p>

  <p><span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> is all about flexibility. If you want to change the design or behaviour of a component (say, adding a class name to a particular element), the power to do so is in your hands &ndash; the template is easy to understand and tweak because it's basically just HTML, and the view logic is straightforward.</p>

  <p>It's better to be able to build your own solution than to rely on developers maintaining high quality and up-to-date documentation.</p>
